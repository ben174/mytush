I created this utility to allow me to send web points from my iPhone to MyFord Touch (Sync). Currently they have a crappy app that is supposed to do this called Sync Destinations. But it sucks. The map data it uses is bad and it is horrible for searching. This allows me to use my native Maps application and just share the point. I email it to an email address, and this script checks that mail address at a regular interval. When it sees a new message, it grabs the map point (VCF file), parses it, then sends it to the web service. 

Feel free to contact me if you have any questions. Or just let me know it's useful - I'd appreciate it.
